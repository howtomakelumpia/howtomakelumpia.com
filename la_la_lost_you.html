                    <h2> Lyrics </h2>
                <p> While I'm on Sunset, are you on the subway?<br>
                    While I drive, are you gettin' on the L-train?<br>
                    I mean, Manhattan's nice, but so are Malibu nights<br>
                    You would know if you stayed, you would know if you put up a fight<br>
                    Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red, rum<br>
                    Does the trick for all of the things left unsaid, I'm<br>
                    Missin' our drunken 2 A.M. strolls in K-Town<br>
                    Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side </p>
                <p> And fuckin' on Brooklyns in Brooklyn<br>
                    Your Chelseas in Chelsea<br>
                    Hope that eases the pain, so you remember to miss me<br>
                    And you sold your car, now you walk for miles<br>
                    Bet your feet feel numb<br>
                    (Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight </p>
                <p> All my demons run wild<br>
                    All my demons have your smile<br>
                    In the city of angels, in the city of angels<br>
                    Hope New York holds you<br>
                    Hope it holds you like I do<br>
                    While my demons stay faithful<br>
                    In the city of angels </p>
                <p> Summer's endin' now and the nights are coolin' down<br>
                    Remember last winter when we would drive around?<br>
                    Silverlake, Hollywood, pretty little white lies got me good<br>
                    Thought this was love, I was misunderstood, mmm </p>
                <p> Feelin' low on the low, drivin' through NoHo<br>
                    If I'm honest, I'd call, but I'm trying to let go<br>
                    And I hope you're happy, livin' life in taxis<br>
                    But you'll always have me, you'll always have me </p>
                <p> All my demons run wild<br>
                    All my demons have your smile<br>
                    In the city of angels, in the city of angels<br>
                    Hope New York holds you<br>
                    Hope it holds you like I do<br>
                    While my demons stay faithful<br>
                    In the city of angels </p>
