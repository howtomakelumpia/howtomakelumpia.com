                    <h2> Lyrics </h2>
                <p> Wonder what I'll do when the cops come through<br>
                    And the whiskey's run out<br>
                    'Cause I've been lookin' at you since half past two<br>
                    Wanna take this downtown?<br>
                    This liquid courage got me way too honest<br>
                    Put your phone on vibrate, let's catch a vibe, babe<br>
                    While the sun's down<br>
                    Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love<br>
                    Be as quiet as you can, 'cause if anyone sees<br>
                    They'll just blow shit up<br>
                    I don't gotta know if you're taken<br>
                    I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant<br>
                    No one's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts wakin' </p>
                <p> Up's the only direction I see<br>
                    As long as we keep this </p>
                <p> Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
                    You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
                    Us in a king-size, keep it a secret<br>
                    Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this<br>
                    Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key </p>
                <p> Wizard with words tellin' me my energy's so bewitchin'<br>
                    So I'll go first, there's an open bar, let's close this distance<br>
                    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my, don't make me have to spell it all night<br>
                    I don't really give a fuck 'bout all the "he said, she said" bullshit<br>
                    So pick your poison, love, let's go somewhere a little more exclusive<br>
                    Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand, boy<br>
                    Tension so intense like an asteroid<br>
                    Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids </p>
                <p> Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems<br>
                    So long as we keep this </p>
                <p> Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
                    You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
                    Us in a king-size, keep it a secret<br>
                    Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this<br>
                    Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key </p>
                <p> low-key, low-key<br>
                    low-key, low-key </p>
