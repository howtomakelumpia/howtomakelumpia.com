                    <h2> Lyrics </h2>
                <p> I guess this is a bitter end I didn't see coming<br>
                    And I'm havin' a little bit of trouble accepting, too<br>
                    I don't know what to say to you<br>
                    There's nothing I can do to reset your point of view<br>
                    We both said this was just physical<br>
                    Well, one of us lied, can't set feelings aside, truth be told, yeah<br>
                    You asked to see me once again at half past ten<br>
                    I got nervous, so I got faded, made things complicated </p>
                <p> I'm sorry for the stupid sh- I said<br>
                    You ordered fun, I served you threats<br>
                    It's probably good you left 'cause I finally admit </p>
                <p> I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Sorry, I never meant to<br>
                    But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say<br>
                    One look at you and I won't have it any other way<br>
                    I want you, I want you, I want you<br>
                    I want you to want me, too<br>
                    I know that I signed up for this casually<br>
                    But I fell for your tricks, I'm the casualty </p>
                <p> Can we just reset, restart and then replay?<br>
                    Take me back to when all<br>
                    You wanted was to love on me everyday, yeah<br>
                    I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Words I will never hear from you<br>
                    Wishing I could turn back the hands of time<br>
                    To when I feel your hands on me<br>
                    And your lips on mine </p>
                <p> I know that that was too much the last time you saw me<br>
                    And I don't blame you for getting over everything so easy<br>
                    But I just can't seem to figure you out<br>
                    You got that mystery<br>
                    Good God, how kiss me<br>
                    Didn't think it'd be distress galore<br>
                    Thought I just wanted you there<br>
                    Wish your hands in my hair<br>
                    But I craved more<br>
                    And you just wanted rock 'n roll, no heart and soul<br>
                    And I knew that from the beginning<br>
                    So why don't I feel like I'm winning? </p>
                <p> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the joke<br>
                    The punchline that got too old<br>
                    It's killing me to see you gone 'cause I never told you </p>
                <p> I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Sorry, I never meant to<br>
                    But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say<br>
                    One look at you and I won't have it any other way<br>
                    I want you, I want you, I want you<br>
                    I want you to want me, too<br>
                    I know that I signed up for this casually<br>
                    But I fell for your tricks, I'm the casualty </p>
                <p> Can we just reset, restart and then replay<br>
                    Take me back to when all<br>
                    You wanted was to love on me everyday, yeah<br>
                    I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Word I will never hear from you<br>
                    Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time<br>
                    To when I feel your hands on me<br>
                    And your lips on mine </p>
                <p> Something about you makes me difficult<br>
                    But that makes us even 'cause you're top of the charts<br>
                    Egotistical, it's so typical<br>
                    For me to fall for your kind<br>
                    But, oh God, I wish you were mine </p>
                <p> I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Sorry, I never meant to (Sorry)<br>
                    But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say<br>
                    One look at you and I won't have it any other way<br>
                    I want you, I want you, I want you<br>
                    I want you to want me, too<br>
                    Would it be a stress if I asked you to try again?<br>
                    I'll be patient, I swear I'll even count to ten<br>
                    One, two, three, four, five<br>
                    F- it </p>
                <p> Can we just reset, restart and then replay (Replay)<br>
                    Take me back to when all<br>
                    You wanted was to love on me everyday, yeah<br>
                    I like you, I like you, I like you<br>
                    Words I will never hear from you<br>
                    Wishin' I could turn back the hands of time<br>
                    To when I like you was just a secret<br>
                    Crime </p>
                <p> Yeah, uh
                </p>
