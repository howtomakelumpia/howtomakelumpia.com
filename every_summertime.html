                    <h2> Lyrics </h2>
                <p> 18, we were undergrads<br>
                    Stayed out late, never made it to class, uh<br>
                    Outer Richmond in a taxi cab<br>
                    You were sweating bullets on the way to my dad's and oh<br>
                    You said, "Baby, think we're moving too fast", ah-ah </p>
                <p> And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (flashed a smile)<br>
                    And that's when I caught me hoping you'd stay a while (stay a while) </p>
                <p> Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind<br>
                    Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime<br>
                    My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely, but you don't have to try<br>
                    'Cause, baby, I fall in love every summertime </p>
                <p> 25, man we're missing church<br>
                    Laugh 'bout everyone we're hating at work<br>
                    Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt<br>
                    Cry the way home, and you're putting me first, oh<br>
                    Yeah, we just always know what to say (mh, ah, yeah) </p>
                <p> We're strolling down the boulevard<br>
                    And dancing under streetlights (oh, the lights)<br>
                    Every year we get older, and I'm still on your side (oh, I) </p>
                <p> Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind<br>
                    Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime<br>
                    My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely, but you don't have to try<br>
                    'Cause, baby, I fall in love every summertime </p>
                <p> Every day is summertime<br>
                    Every day is summertime<br>
                    Every day is summertime with you </p>
                <p> Every day is summertime<br>
                    Every day is summertime<br>
                    Every day is summertime with you </p>
